        This is a way to join a football academy, however is the least likely one. Simply because you need a lot of luck.This is sometimes described as climbing the ladder to the top.You basically join any soccer team regardless of the level. When you play, you will always have the chance of showing your skills and abilities.This is the beauty of football, everyone has the chance to play, everyone has the chance to showcase themselves and succeed.If you are different, with abilities that overshadow the other players, and perform correctly in the soccer field, there will always be a chance of someone seeing you and wanting to sign you.
